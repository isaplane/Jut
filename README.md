# Jut

A collection of helper procedures, utilties, data structures, and algorithms I find useful for programming in Jai.

I add things as I need them, so this collection may be quite incomplete for now.

## Data structures
### BSP (Binary Space Partition)
- Very simple. Struct containing arbitrary data can be stored with each node.

## Utilties
### ASTist
- A collection of utility procedures for working with the Abstract Syntax Trees created by the Jai compiler.
